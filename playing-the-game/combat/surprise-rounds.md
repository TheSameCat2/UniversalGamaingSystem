# Surprise Rounds

In certain circumstances, certain parties will not be aware of opponents when combat begins. In this case, the parties that are aware will get to take part in an extra round, where the aware parties take a turn in initiative order, skipping the parties that are unaware. After the surprise round, all parties are assumed aware, unless the attack is made in stealth (see Using Stealth).
