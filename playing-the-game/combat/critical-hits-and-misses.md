Sometimes both the wonderful and the horrible happen in real life. These are the moments that define us as people, and are almost always the most memorable. Cinematic represents these moments as critical hits and critical misses.\

You have scored a critical hit when you roll a natural 12 on 2d6. This means that you have achieved the peak of your potential and luck has smiled on you during your attempt. The on a critical hit you will deal extra damage determined by what type of weapon you are using. If you are unarmed, you deal +1 HP of damage on a critical hit.\

Critical misses are when you roll a natural 2 on 2d6 - also known as snake eyes. Disaster strikes when you see snake eyes! Rolling a critical miss is always a miss, even if your total with modifiers would have succeeded. Additionally, the Game Master may decide that your misfortune extends even further, and you could fall victim to a tragic circumstance! Dropping your weapon, falling flat on your face, and even taking a small amount of damage from a misstep are all within the realm of possibility.
