# Initiative Checks

The order that turns are taken in combat is determined by the Initiative Order. At the beginning of combat, the game master will instruct the players involved to make an Initiative Check, which means to roll 2d6 and add their Initiative Modifier on their character sheet. This value is equal to the characters dexterity modifier plus any bonuses from talents, etc.\

The game master will also make initiative checks for the opponents and note them on a separate sheet of paper. The involved parties then begin taking their turns in order, starting with the highest initiative check, in descending order.
