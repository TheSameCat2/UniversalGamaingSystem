# Dodging

If an opponent hits you with an attack, you may attempt a dodge check. In order to dodge, you must succeed an DC8 dodge roll by at least as much as your attacker succeeded their attack (an opposed check). If you succeed your dodge check, the attack misses you, but you are at a -3 to attacks and fine movements during the next round.
