# Using Stealth

You can make an opposed stealth check to run away from opponents that you are in melee with, if your GM allows it. Circumstances may not permit using stealth to escape, such as if there is no cover available or if your opponents are able to move significantly faster than you are. The GM is the final arbiter of if this option is available.
