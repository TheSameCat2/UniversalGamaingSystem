# Taking Damage

When you are hit by an attack, you may take damage. The amount of damage you take will depend on what type of attack hit you, and what kind of equipment (if any) you are wearing. Some armour in Cinematic absorbs some of the damage for you.\
\
Damage output is determined by rolling an appropriate number of d6 die, and adding the resulting rolls and any modifiers that apply to the attack. This damage is dealt to the opponent, who then subtracts any armour protection, then reduces their available hit points by the remaining amount.\
\
When your hit points reach zero, you fall unconscious and begin to die.
