# The Combat Round

Combat is described in Cinematic as taking place in rounds. Each round describes what the players and opponents are doing for a six-second period. The actions are said to take place simultaneously, however since it is impossible for all the players to state their actions at the same time, the round is broken up into turns. The order of turns is determined by something called an initiative check that will be explained later in this section.\
\
Each turn consists of:

* 1 Significant Action
* 1 Insignificant Action
* 1 Move Action
* Several Free Actions

You do not have to take the actions in any specific order, nor do you have to use each action every turn. Unused turns do not roll over to the next turn; they are lost at the end of your turn.\
\
A Significant action may be used as an additional move action. Move actions however, may not be used as additional significant actions.
