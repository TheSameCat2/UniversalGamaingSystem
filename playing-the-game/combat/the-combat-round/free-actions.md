# Free Actions

Talking to other characters, dropping something on the ground in your own space, certain spells, and numerous other things that take no time and require no concentration are free actions. The game master is the final arbiter of both what is a free action, and how many free actions a player may have per round.\
\
The game master may have to limit free actions if they begin to be abused by some players. While long conversations during game may be normal most of the time, during a six second combat round limitless conversation may detract from the energy of the game. In this situation, the game master may limit the amount of conversation allowed per round to keep the energy moving. You may also be limited from performing a long chain of free actions that would actually require concentration to perform in six short seconds. Remember, the GM is the final arbiter of how many free actions you can take â€“ so ask if you are not sure.
