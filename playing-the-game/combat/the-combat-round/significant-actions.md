# Significant Actions

A significant action is described as any primary action, or any undefined action that would take a significant portion of your six-second turn.\
\
Examples of significant actions are attacks, some skill checks, casting a spell, etc. In general, if it would cause damage, you can safely assume it is a significant action unless you have a good reason to think otherwise (like the rule text of a special spell).
