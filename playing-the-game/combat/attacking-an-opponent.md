# Attacking An Opponent

Attacking your opponent is done the same way you make a skill check. You roll your weapon skill against a DC known by the game master to hit your opponent.\
\
Whether this DC is known to the player is up to the game master. Some game masters prefer the DC to be secret, while others prefer the players being fully informed about the factors affecting their roll. Cinematic does not take sides in this debate.\
\
If the player succeeds their attack roll, the target of the attack may attempt to dodge if they are aware of their attacker (see Surprise Rounds).
