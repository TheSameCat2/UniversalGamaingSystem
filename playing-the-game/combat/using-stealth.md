# Using Stealth

You may use stealth to surprise your opponent. If the opponent is not already aware of you, make an opposed check of the stealth skill against your opponent's awareness skill. (These skills may vary depending on the GM's skill setup.) If your stealth check exceeds your opponent's awareness check, they are considered surprised if attacked during that round. Your opponent may make another awareness check each round that you attempt to elude them.
