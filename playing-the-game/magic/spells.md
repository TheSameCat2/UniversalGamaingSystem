# Spells

Spells are the building block of magic in Cinematic. When you want to do something magical, you cast a spell. Think of a spell as its own self contained microcosm of rules. The game master will give you a list of spells that are available in their world, listed by caster level. You can cast any spell of your talent level or lower.\
\
The rules for each spell dictate when you can cast the spells, along with what the effects are. The spell text is considered the final authority for determining how a spell works. Some spells may contradict the normal rules of the Cinematic game. This is fine, just go with what the spell's text says, and you will be fine.\

_I recommend copying each spell's rule text to a separate index card, and keeping these with your character sheet. This will make casting spells faster and less argument prone, since you will have the rule text with you._
