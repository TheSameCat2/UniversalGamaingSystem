# Magic Is A Talent

If you are playing a caster, your character will have some sort of talent provided by your GM that gives you magical ability. This can be called a wide variety of things depending on the setting, from simply "magic" to "arcanism” or “divine channelling.” The level of the talent you take will determine how powerful of a spell you can cast, and will influence how many times you can perform certain feats of magic per day.
