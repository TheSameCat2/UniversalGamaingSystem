# Why Do People Roleplay?

There are many different reasons that people are attracted to roleplaying. Some people are attracted to pretending to be someone else. Others enjoy escaping from reality and entering into a world where the good people really do win. Still others enjoy getting to live out fantasies that are impossible (or too scary!) to live out in real life. If you are a game master, you may have a passion for telling stories and enjoy the instant gratification that GM's have when telling these stories interactively. These are all equally legitimate reasons to roleplay, and they only scratch the surface of the reasons people have.
