# Introduction

What is Cinematic? Cinematic is a gaming system designed from the ground up to support game masters who like to design their own custom worlds. When I started Game Mastering my own games, I quickly discovered that a lot of the pleasure in running a game for me came from the ability to redefine reality as I saw fit, and create totally unique experiences. This approach to gaming is a lot of work, but it pays off in the immersive gaming experience I was able to provide my players. I went through many systems during my first couple of years in roleplaying. Most of them were good at what they did. They provided a framework for playing a specific type of game, within a few predefined parameters, and gave a smooth, consistent, and enjoyable experience to the players. Most players pretty much know what to expect when someone offers to run a game in X system, because the system offers a consistent experience. While these are all positive attributes for a system in most circumstances, in the case of a game master who wants a completely custom tailored experience, this can cause a lot of confusion and player frustration. This system aims to alleviate that by providing only core mechanics to support custom magic systems, weapons, armour, etc. within a predicable algorithm to ensure that your combats remain balanced and difficulty in tasks is predictable.
