# Dialog

Part of roleplaying in a tabletop game is engaging in dialog with the other players in the game “in character.” Speaking in character means that you are playing the voice of your character the same way that an actor plays the voice of an imagined character in a movie or television show. Speaking in someone else's voice may seem awkward at first, but it will become more natural the longer you do it.\
Some players find it enjoyable to give their character a unique accent, or a catch phrase that they repeat on a regular basis. A character that has a strong peasant's accent and exclaims, “By Tyr's Beard!” is much more interesting in certain situations than the person who sounds just like you and says, “Holy shit!” Depending on the genera of the game, the period you are playing in, and the composition of the group, either option may be appropriate. If you are in doubt, have a conversation with your game master. He or she will be able to give you invaluable information about what style of speech will be most enjoyable in their game world.\
Before long, you will be having hour-long conversations with other people that do not exist, and it will seem the most natural thing in the world. Whether this makes you a touch crazy or not, we leave for you to decide for yourself.\
One note of caution: it is important to ensure that the players all know for sure when you are speaking in character and when you are speaking as yourself. A comment that your character would make to another character might be offensive to the player if you say it to themselves. One group I was a part of would hold their hands in the shape of a capital T, similar to a coach calling "time out” when they intended to speak out of character. The rest of the time, we assumed them to be speaking as their character.\
For example, dialog at the gaming table may go something like this:

_Paige (EID): "I walk into the room and take a seat at the table. I call out, I know you're in here... you might as well come out.'_\
_Darin (Halfling): “I slip out of the shadows and step into the candlelight. 'You are late to the meeting elf. I do not tolerate being kept waiting.'"_\
_Darin looks at the GM. "I am going to throw my dagger at Paige.”_\
_GM: "Ok. I need both of you to roll Initiative.”_\
\
_The players both roll, and Darin wins._\
_GM: “Paige, you see a dagger glint as Darin reaches into his sleeve, and a moment later the hilt is sticking out of your chest! You feel a burning sensation spreading throughout your body. What do you do?”_\
_Paige: “You fiend! You will never find the jewels now. The secret will go with w me to my grave!'GM, I am going to flee the room!”_
