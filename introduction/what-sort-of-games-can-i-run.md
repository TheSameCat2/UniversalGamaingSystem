# What Sort of Games Can I Run?

With a bit of work you should be able to run games in any genera including fantasy, science fiction, western, modern fantasy, paranormal, and horror. I play-tested this version of it using a fantasy game, but the concepts are universal, and I have played enough science fiction games to keep them in mind. Running any game in the Universal Gaming System will take more work than it will in another, more defined, system. Other systems make many assumptions about your game, your players, and the type of interactions you will be having with your players. These assumptions are fine until they are not true. I have tried to make very few assumptions in the design of this system, which means that you will have to define certain elements of gameplay for yourself. You will have to define things like:

1. How magic works (or is there magic), and the spells characters can use
2. What types of equipment are available
3. What types of characters the players are allowed to play
4. What races and professions can characters play, and what are their special abilities
5. Much, much more...

The advantage of doing this extra work is that you will be able to present a completely custom game to your players! The downside of this is that your player cannot tell you he wants to play a 6" level elven ranger, build a character sheet on his own in an hour, and be ready to play. You will have to define what being an elf even means and character design will go from there. 1 ule elves in your game are technomancers who have merged with a sentient quantum computer Trom an alien planet, you will be glad you had this flexibility.
