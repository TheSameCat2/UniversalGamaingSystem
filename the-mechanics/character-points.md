# Character Points

Character points are what you spend to buy attributes, talents, and abilities for your character. The number of them that you have invested into the mechanics of your character can be considered a measure of how powerful they are.\
Your Game Master will give you a certain amount of character points when you begin designing your character sheet. These points are for initial character design, and should all be spent during the creation step. You may not be allowed to keep them after the initial setup of your character.\
You may also receive character points during the course of the game (or not, depending on your GM) with which to power up your character. Think of spending points mid-game as reflecting the skills and experience you have acquired over time.
