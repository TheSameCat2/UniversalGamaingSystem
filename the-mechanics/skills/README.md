# Skills

Skills are the bread and butter of character action and interaction. Almost all of the things your character will do on a day-to-day basis will be based on skill rolls. Skills represent anything you can learn how to do if offered the appropriate training and opportunities.\
Skills are represented mechanically by a number of character points converted into a Die Modifier (DM) based on the chart below. Skills are sorted by their difficulty, which represents how strenuous the skill is and how difficult it is to learn it. A skill that most people can perform or learn is considered an Easy skill. Something that only an expert in a field could perform would be a Hard skill. Only the very best in any area dare to perform Very Hard skills on a regular basis.
