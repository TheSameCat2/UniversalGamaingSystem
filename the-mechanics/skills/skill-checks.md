# Skill Checks

A skill check is made to determine if you succeed or fail at a skill attempt. To make a skill check, you roll 2d6, and add the total to the DMs that apply to the skill. The total is your roll. When you add the numbers up, you tell the game master “I rolled an X” (X is the number you rolled.)\
\
Skill levels vary between zero and four. A skill of zero means that you have baseline training in a skill. If you do not have a DM of at least zero in a skill, you are said to be defaulting the roll and suffer a -3 DM to your roll. A skill DM of 2 means that you are a professional, 3 that you are a master in your field, and 4 represents someone who would be considered a paragon - a once in a lifetime paradigm changer - who others will attempt to emulate for years.

| DM | Easy | Normal | Hard | Very Hard |
| -- | :--: | :----: | :--: | :-------: |
| 0  |   1  |    2   |   3  |     4     |
| +1 |   2  |    4   |   6  |     8     |
| +2 |   3  |    6   |   9  |     12    |
| +3 |   4  |    8   |  12  |     16    |
| +4 |   5  |   10   |  15  |     20    |

You may not have a skill level above four unless the game master applies some very special exceptions to your character. You will have to work directly with the game master to design such a character.\
\
Skills are also based on an attribute, which means that when you roll a skill check you will add the skill DM, the ability modifier for the ability the skill is based on, and the die roll.\
The game master compares the number the player made on a roll to a Difficulty Check (DC). If the roll is above the DC, the player succeeds. If it is lower, the player fails – so a high skill die modifier increases your odds of succeeding at a task.
