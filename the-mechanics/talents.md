# Talents

A talent is a special ability that you cannot acquire by sheer effort. It is an innate ability â€“ it sets you apart from the rest of the normal world.\


You purchase talents in levels, a concept which will appear several times in the mechanics of this system. Typical skills cost six character points per level, but these may be adjusted by your GM depending on the rarity of the ability in their campaign. Depending on what level you choose to purchase, talents bestow certain abilities.\


For instance, if you are designing a powerful wizard, you might choose to purchase Arcana Level 5, for 15 character points. In this case, Arcana 5 grants you the ability to cast fifth level spells, and determines the number of mana points you have to power those spells. You will have to ask your game master for a list of talents (if any) that are available in their game.

**Example Talents**

| Talent Name                        |      Cost |
| ---------------------------------- | --------: |
| Arcana (Magic)                     | 6 pts/lvl |
| Lightning Reflexes (+1 initiative) | 5 pts/lvl |
