# Talents

Game masters should take care in designing talents to ensure that they do not augment skills in a way that overpowers the game mechanic. Talents should be reserved for abilities and bonuses that cannot be granted any other way. Talents that increase the amount of damage that a character can do per round (via extra attacks, damage bonuses, etc.) should cost more than normal talents and be subject to level caps. A general guideline is that every extra die of damage should cost at least 3 pts.
