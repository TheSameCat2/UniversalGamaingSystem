# Game Mastering

The game master is the referee of the roleplaying game. The GM decides what happens, who wins in contests, and controls the flow of the game. They also do all the work of planning the story of the game, and designing adventures for the players to embark upon.\
\
People commonly decide to become a game master because they find that they have a story to tell, or because they want to craft an experience for their friends. Others learn to become a game master because nobody else wants to be one, or because they have an experience that they do not want to repeat under another game master!\
\
Whatever your reason for wanting to be a game master, I endeavour to explain the basics that you will need to know about game mastering, along with the rules of Cinematic that apply specifically to the game master, such as world, equipment, skill, talent, and creature creation.
