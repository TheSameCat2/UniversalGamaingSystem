# Damage

All damage is represented by a number of damage dice. You should keep in mind the maximum and minimum amounts of damage that a spell can cause each round in order to keep the game balanced. Average damage dealt will be a mean of the minimum and maximum value.

| Damage Amount | Level Cost |
| ------------- | ---------: |
| 1d6           |         +1 |
| 2d6           |         +2 |
| 3d6           |         +3 |
| 4d6           |         +4 |
| 5d6           |         +5 |
| 6d6           |         +6 |

And so on....
