# The Nitty Gritty

The Universal Gaming System handles magic in a building block fashion behind the scenes. You connect the things you want a spell to do, add up the cost of each piece, and you have the level of the spell. Generating the mechanics of a spell can literally take seconds once you are familiar with the building pieces. Once you have the mechanical portion built, it is up to you as the GM to write a bit about how the spell looks, feels, and how it "works‚Äù in your game world. This is the most important part of spell design, since it is the most influential to your games tone.
