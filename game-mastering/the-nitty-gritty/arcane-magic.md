# Arcane Magic

Building an arcane spell is easy.

1. Choose your level of damage. Note the cost for this damage level.
2. Choose the area your damage is applied to. Note the cost for this as well.
3. Select abilities that are attached to the spell. Does it catch the area on fire? Does it make someone move? Does it shoot shards of ice? These things can both add and subtract from the cost of the spell. Note all of these abilities and their costs.
4. Add the costs and abilities together and describe how the spell works on a card. The total of all added costs is the level of the spell. Only casters with that level talent or above can cast this spell, and it costs mana equal to its level.

Teleportation spells are a little different. These spells are primarily based around how far you are going, whether you have been there before, the ability to carry others, etc. These spells are still built by adding the cost of abilities, but there is no damage or area elements - just distance and ability.

_Example:_

To build a teleportation spell:

1. Decide how far the spell can carry you. Note the cost.
2. Decide what abilities the teleportation has. Can you carry cargo? Passengers? Note the costs.
3. Add the costs, and describe how the spell works on a card.
