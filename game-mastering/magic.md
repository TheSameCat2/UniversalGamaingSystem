# Magic

Not all fantasy games need magic. Not all sci-fi games should exclude it. Be creative. You should be aware though, that including magic will add a level of difficulty to your job as a GM. Be sure whether you want magic to be available to your characters before you begin your game. You will want to account for the power that your characters will be capable of wielding when you design encounters.\

There are several types of magic that the Universal Gaming System supports, and you can easily modify them to cover almost any imaginable magic system. At the built in level, the Universal Gaming System supports arcane casting, psionics, and alchemy. You can combine these to create game magics that draw inspiration from Tolkien, Sanderson, Rothfuss, etc. (e.g. combining the arcane and alchemical systems to provide a Mystborn style magic to players)\

Your gamers do not need to know how you used the spell/ability generation rules to create your magic system. The important part is that your players know exactly how their abilities work, their powers are consistent, and the power of their abilities matches the expectations you have for your game. You do not need a low level character suddenly possessing the ability to destroy a mountain, and your players do not want to learn a bad-ass spell only to find out it is not powerful enough to handle a common bar room thug.
