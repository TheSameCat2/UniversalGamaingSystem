# Goals and Motivations

First, consider what your character's goals are. You need to spend as much time as is necessary to have a good idea of your characters goals and motivations. These things move your character forward, and make life worth living for him. Why does he get out of bed in the morning? What are his goals? Where does he see his life going, and how does he want to get there?
