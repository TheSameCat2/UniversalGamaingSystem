# Designing A Character

Designing a character can be a very exciting process! It is a new beginning, which only comes once in most games. The paradigm in Cinematic is to design the "who" of your character first, then to make sure that the mechanical design of your character reflects this concept.

**Goals and Motivations**

First, consider what your character's goals are. You need to spend as much time as is necessary to have a good idea of your characters goals and motivations. These things move your character forward, and make life worth living for him. Why does he get out of bed in the morning? What are his goals? Where does he see his life going, and how does he want to get there?

**Abilities**

Next, ask yourself what your character is good at doing. What are his talents, abilities, and skills that set him apart from the average crowd? Every character should have at least one ability that makes him stand out. (Even if not being noticed is your skill!) Try not to think in mechanical terms during this portion of the character generation. Think in real world terms.\
Now, think of things that your character is horrible at doing. It may not seem obvious to new roleplayers, but the things we are bad at define us just as much as the things we are good at doing! Failure, while not our favorite thing, is an essential part of success. The wizard with phenomenal cosmic power who cannot tie his own shoes is much more interesting than the person who can do everything, all the time.

**Backstory**

If you have time, you may also want to write out a backstory explaining where your character came from. Some game masters may even require this step, because it will add a great deal of depth to your character. Make sure you have the game master's assistance with this step, should you chose to take it. You will want to ensure that nothing you place in your backstory will conflict with world-specific timelines and items. Having a clear idea of where your character came from can give you a better idea of where he is going, not to mention having stories to tell around the proverbial camp fire in game.
